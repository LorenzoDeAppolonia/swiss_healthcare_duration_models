# Swiss Healthcare Spitex Services Duration Prediction

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict the duration of Spitex services needed by patients, enhancing healthcare service allocation efficiency in Switzerland.

## Dataset
Utilizes a comprehensive dataset covering 251,034 training and 62,759 testing instances across 18 features, after preprocessing steps such as encoding and scaling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Involves data cleaning, feature analysis, and statistical summaries to uncover insights and prepare data for modeling.

## Feature Engineering and Preprocessing
Details methods to handle outliers, scale data, and modify class distributions for balanced analysis.

## Model Development
Evaluates models including softmax regression, decision trees, random forest, Adaboost, soft voting classifier, and neural networks, highlighting Adaboost's superior performance.

## Conclusions
Discusses the balance between model complexity and predictive accuracy, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in healthcare.
